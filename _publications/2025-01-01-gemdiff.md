A Transformer-based diffusion model (GEMDiff) for simulating realistic tumor gene expression profiles and bridging normal and tumor biological states. Breast cancer case study. Enables synthesis of biological states under varying perturbations with high-throughput inference on multi-GPU/Slurm infrastructure.
