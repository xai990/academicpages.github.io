I am a **Ph.D. Candidate in Computer Engineering** at Clemson University, advised by Prof. Melissa C. Smith. My research focuses on **Generative AI and Foundation Models for Genomics**—including Transformer-based diffusion models (e.g., GemDiff) for simulating realistic biological states and multi-GPU/Slurm-based high-throughput inference.

I have experience developing modular reasoning workflows for single-cell epigenomics at **MD Anderson Cancer Center** (Applied Research Intern, May–Nov 2025) and at Clemson as a **Graduate Research Assistant** (Jan 2022–Present), with an emphasis on genomic language modeling and therapeutic design.

**Research interests:** Diffusion models, Transformers, VAEs, single-cell multi-omics (scRNA-seq, scATAC-seq), trajectory inference, latent representation learning, and high-dimensional data integration.
